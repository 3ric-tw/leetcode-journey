# LeetCode Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning algorithms and programming through LeetCode practice, with the goal of enhancing my skills as a Linux system administrator and become a real DevOps/SRE engineer.

As I progress in my journey, I will update this README and add more details about my learning process, challenges faced, and achievements.

## Learning Goals

- Language: Python
- Improve my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills, which will enhance my capabilities in creating efficient automation scripts and handling complex system challenges. 

### Short-term Goal 2024-12-03 to 2025-02-28:

- Practice at least `2` LeetCode `Easy` problems every week
- Document my learning process

### 2024-12-14

I am very fortunate to have received an opportunity for a second round interview with my dream company. Currently, I am actively preparing for the remaining interviews, which include topics such as operating systems, networking, scripting, and behavioral interviews. Since the position I'm interviewing for doesn't focus on LeetCode-style questions, I'm temporarily pausing updates to this series until interviews are completed.
